        About me 
        <br>
        “I have always loved capturing the moments of life. So, my sister suggested that I try my hand at professional photography.   I bought a small DSLR Canon and started shooting.   I fell in love with the profession and adopted the mantra “It's not just a photo but an experience!”  I wanted to use my abilities to then create opportunities for young people to have affordable access to professional grade headshots, events shots, and portraiture.”

        <h2>Types of Photos</h2>
        <p> 
        What type of photos are you looking to get? Photos can bring out emotion and have the ability to capture moments but selecting the type of photo you want can help me tailor more to what you are looking for. 
        <br>
        Selection of photo types: 
        <br>
        1. Wedding Photos (cost of the photo)

        </p>
    

        <h3>The Meaning of Color:</h3>
        <p>
        Color means everything when taking photos, certain colors pop more than others and others create a different realm of visuality when matched perfectly.
