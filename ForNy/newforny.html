            <h2>To the most Beautiful Woman I know: </h2>
            <p>
                These last three months with you have been the highlight of my college career. I never knew that someones smile and laughter could make my day so special. I never knew someones soul could radiate such beautiful energy. I never knew that God would bless me with someone so incredible.
            </p>
            <p>
                You make my days brighter, my mind calmer and most importantly my life easier. I am so blessed to be with someone who respects me and loves me the way I have always dreamed of. Thank you so much for being your authentic and beautiful self. I couldn't ask for more.
