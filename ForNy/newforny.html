            <p>
                These last three months with you have been the highlight of my college career. I never knew that someones smile and laughter could make my day so special. I never knew someones soul could radiate such beautiful energy. I never knew that God would bless me with someone so incredible. As a man it is my job to protect you and I promise you I will do that and much more. As a follower of Christ I will lead you as best I can and I will continue to do my best to nurture our relationship
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyday you continiously make my days brighter, my mind calmer and most importantly my life easier. I am so blessed to be with someone who respects me and loves me the way I have always dreamed of. Thank you so much for being your authentic and beautiful self. I couldn't ask for more.. I love you Ny 🥹
